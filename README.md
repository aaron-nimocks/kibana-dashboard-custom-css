## Kibana Plugin for Custom CSS on Dashboards

This plugin will allow you to create CSS files and apply them for every dashboard independently.

Currently a work in progress but functional. Looking to clean up the code and add more error handling. This is my first nodejs/react project.

Developed on Kibana version 7.7.1
